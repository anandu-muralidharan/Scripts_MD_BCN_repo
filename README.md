# Scripts_MD_BCN_repo
The main scripts i will be using to analyse and customise the BCN meshes for the MD simulations.
1. Customize_graphene_layer.ipynb
   Here, we can use ASE package to customise the graphene mesh. I am using this to get different compositions of the BCN network.
   One issue as of noe is that we have to input the index of the atoms to be replaced. This can be visualised from the jupyter script itself.
